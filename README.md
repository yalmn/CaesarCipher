# Caesar Cipher in C++

This project implements a simple Caesar Cipher encryption and decryption algorithm in C++.

## Description

The Caesar Cipher is a basic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet. This project includes a `CaesarCipher` class that provides methods for encrypting and decrypting text using a specified shift value.

## Features

- Encrypts a given text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Decrypts a given text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.
- Allows the user to input the shift value and text via the command line.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)

### Installing

1. Clone the repository:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/yalmn/caesarcipher.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```
    cd caesarcipher
    ```

### Compiling

Compile the program using a C++ compiler. For example, using `g++`:
```
g++ -o caesarcipher caesarcipher.cpp
```
## Running the Program

Run the compiled program:
```
./caesarcipher
```

Follow the instructions provided by the program:

    - Enter the shift value (an integer).
    - Enter the text to be encrypted or decrypted.
    - Choose whether to encrypt or decrypt the text by entering e or d.

## Example

```
Enter the shift value: 3
Enter the text: Hello, World!
Encrypt or Decrypt (e/d): e
Encrypted text: Khoor, Zruog!
```
